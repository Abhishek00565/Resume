                        Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, each comprising 11 players. It
                        originated in England in the 16th century and has since become a global phenomenon, especially
                        in countries like India, Australia, and England. The game is divided into innings, with one team
                        batting while the other fields. The batting team's objective is to score runs by hitting the
                        ball and running between wickets, while the bowling team aims to dismiss the batsmen and limit
                        their runs. Cricket features various formats, including Test matches, One-Day Internationals
                        (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches, each with different rules and durations, catering to a wide
                        audience of enthusiasts worldwide.

                        </h2>
                        Football, also known as soccer in some regions, is a globally beloved team sport. It involves
                        two teams of 11 players each who compete to score goals by getting a round ball into the
                        opposing team's net. The game is played on a rectangular field, with the objective of using
                        feet, head, or any part of the body except the hands (for goalkeepers) to control and pass the
                        ball. Football is characterized by its simplicity, teamwork, and emphasis on skill, speed, and
                        strategy. It has a massive following and is associated with passionate fans, prestigious
                        tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, and numerous professional leagues worldwide.

                        </p>
                        Volleyball is a fast-paced team sport played between two teams, with each side comprising six
                        players. The objective is to score points by sending the ball over the net and into the opposing
                        team's court while preventing them from doing the same. Players use a combination of spiking,
                        blocking, serving, and passing techniques to control the ball. Volleyball is known for its quick
                        rallies and requires excellent coordination, communication, and agility among teammates. It's
                        played both indoors and on the beach, with various formats and rules, and is popular for its
                        accessibility, inclusivity, and the thrilling atmosphere it creates in both casual and
                        competitive settings.
